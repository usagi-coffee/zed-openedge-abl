# OpenEdge ABL for Zed

This is a language package for the [Zed](http://zed.dev) code editor that adds support for the [OpenEdge ABL](http://www.progress.com/openedge) language.

Currently it's experimental and only provides syntax highlighting, the underlying grammar is noweher near complete so don't expect it to work perfectly.

# Installation

It is probably not going to be submitted to the Zed extension repository, so you have to install it manually, to install simply clone the repository and use `Install Dev Extension` feature in Zed. Be patient, it might take a while to compile the grammar.
