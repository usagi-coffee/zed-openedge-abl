# OpenEdge ABL for Zed

This is a language package for the [Zed](http://zed.dev) code editor that adds support for the [OpenEdge ABL](http://www.progress.com/openedge) language.

# Installation

Currently the only way to install the extension is to use Zed's `Install Dev Extension` feature.

```
git clone https://github.com/usagi-coffee/zed-openedge-abl
# Use `Install Dev Extension` on the cloned directory inside Zed Extension Page
# Be patient, it might take a while to compile the grammar.
```
